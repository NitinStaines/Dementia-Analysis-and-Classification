# 🧠 Dementia Analysis and Risk Prediction System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project presents a machine learning-based system for early dementia risk prediction. It integrates exploratory data analysis (EDA), interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling to assist healthcare professionals in identifying dementia likelihood based on patient demographics, cognitive assessments, and clinical history.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier for dementia risk prediction.  
- Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit for real-time visualizations.  
- User-Friendly Interface: Allows clinicians to input patient data and receive instant risk assessments (Low, Mild, High).  
- Data-Driven Insights: Analyzes factors like MMSE scores, age, SES, brain volume metrics, etc.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Dementia is a progressive condition affecting cognitive function. Early detection is crucial but challenging due to complex influencing factors. Traditional diagnostic methods are costly and time-consuming. This system streamlines risk assessment using machine learning, providing faster, reliable predictions to aid early intervention.  

## 🎯 Motivation  
With dementia cases rising globally, accessible, data-driven tools are essential for early diagnosis and better patient management. Our system aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce costs, and enhance clinical decision-making.
